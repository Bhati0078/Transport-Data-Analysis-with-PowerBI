# Description:
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive analysis of transportation data using Power BI. The analysis is based on a provided dataset, focusing on key metrics such as Total Miles, Loaded Miles, Shipping Cost, Revenue, and Ship Days.

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to leverage Power BI for in-depth exploration, visualization, and interpretation of transportation data. Through interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations, the aim is to derive actionable insights and inform strategic decisions in the transportation domain.

# Key Features:
* Data Exploration: Detailed exploration of the dataset to understand distribution, trends, and characteristics of transportation data.
* Visualizations: A variety of visualizations are utilized, including time series analysis for Ship Date and Delivery Date, geographic analysis using maps, and trend analysis for Revenue 
  and Shipping Cost over time.
* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Relevant KPIs such as average shipping cost per mile, revenue per mile, and capacity utilization rate are defined and calculated.
  Filtering and Slicing: Implementation of filters and slicers enables dynamic data exploration, allowing users to focus on specific time periods, categories, or trip types.

# Conclusion

• This project analyzed transportation data to gain insights into costs, revenue, and efficiency across various categories. Here are the key takeaways
• Domestic shipping is the most prevalent trip type, but it also appears to be the least profitable due to a higher average cost per mile compared to revenue.
• Intercom trips consistently generate the highest average revenue per mile, suggesting they might be a more strategic focus for profitability.
• Despite having the highest overall revenue, origin state Illinois is not necessarily the most efficient based on average revenue per mile. In contrast, Minnesota emerges as the 
  destination state with the highest overall revenue.
  • There seems to be a significant discrepancy between capacity utilization rate values across visualizations (Domestic & Intercom). Further investigation is needed to understand this 
  consistency.
